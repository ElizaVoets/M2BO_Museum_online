                        <h3>2008 - 2011</h3>
                        <p>
                            A garage box in The Hague is where the adventure began in 2008, 
                            with two friends Hasan Tasdemir and Pascal Rappailles. 
                            The garage box soon became too small after which they moved to a shed in an industrial area. 
                            Unfortunately, the shed was not heated and everything had to be moved to an empty Ministry of Agriculture building in the middle of winter. 
                            When this building also had to be vacated, the then collection of 10 arcade video games with some spare parts was stored 
                            in an old classic car showroom. 
                            Since there was no room there to renovate or play the cabinets, suitable space was sought.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            That was found in 2011 at the Cobaltstraat in Zoetermeer. 
                            There Hasan decided to rent the location with 4 friends and the adventure could grow into their own meeting place 
                            to practice their hobby and relax with a game.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Soon there were more people who wanted to participate, 
                            which meant that both the location and the hobby approach were no longer adequate, in addition to everyone's daily work. 
                            The initiative was in danger of succumbing to its success. 
                            It was therefore decided by the friends that a professional approach was necessary and it could no longer be continued on a hobby basis. 
                            By mutual agreement, it was decided that one of the friends, Hasan Tasdemir, would try to develop the concept into a business. 
                            In which the others would support him with advice and assistance in their spare time.

                            <h3>2014</h3>
                            <p>
                                Hasan decided to leave Cobaltstraat in 2014 and move to Bleiswijkseweg. 
                                Since income was still marginal, only anti-squatting properties could be rented, 
                                which still required frequent moves. 
                                From the Stephensonstraat to the Edisonstraat where beautiful events under the name Retro Planet were organized for the community. 
                                The collection also continued to expand. While the interest in retro gaming from family and friends grew bigger and bigger.
                                <br><br>
                                For that reason, in 2015 Hasan took the important step of bringing his now extensive collection into a professional company called Playworks BV.

                            <h3>2016</h3>
                            <p>
                                In 2016, Hasan came into contact with Jan Kragt, 
                                city marketer of the municipality of Zoetermeer, 
                                who, deeply impressed by the collection, 
                                suggested the idea of turning it into a museum and establishing a foundation to do so. 
                                On the spot, Hasan and Jan came up with the name and the National Videogame Museum was born. 
                                Together with a number of important players from the Dutch game community, the National Videogame Museum Foundation was then created. 
                                was created.
                            </p>


                            <p>
                                The city council was enthusiastic about the idea and decided to support the museum financially. 
                                This made it possible to rent a heated storage facility where the entire collection could be housed and partially exhibited.

                            <h3>2017</h3>
                            <p>
                                Starting in May 2017, a large group of volunteers and fans worked extremely hard to get the museum's pilot set up 
                                so that it was ready to play on December 1, 2017! The huge influx of enthusiastic visitors and the many positive comments about our museum speak for themselves.
                            </p>

                            <h3>nu</h3>
                            <p>
                                In the meantime, they have been busy expanding the museum, 
                                deepening the experience and enhancing the museological and educational value of their beautiful museum. 
                                They are making every effort to further professionalize the museum and get it ready for the next "level" in a permanent and definitive location.

                                As a parent totally look to have commodore 64 floppies in your hands or good old fashioned duckhunting,  
                                but then also just end up on the ps5 and play all the arcade games of the past with your child. 
                                Gee what memories you can tangibly transfer to your child here as a parent.  
                                Truly a must do!
                                4 stars because it was too short by corona and the hospitality is lousy limited. Otherwise 5 stars.

                                what a super fun museum. 
                                Wonderful to get started with these games. 
                                It was like going to an arcade in the old days without all those guilders 
                                and not even mentioning the retro gaming consoles that are plenty there. 
                                I hope we get to see a lot more.
